## Context Menu Commands

Right-click in an `.http` or `.rest` file to access:

- **Send Request** - Send request at cursor
- **Copy Request As cURL** - Copy as curl command
- **Generate Code Snippet** - Generate code in another language
- **Rest Client: Request History** - Open history panel

## CodeLens Actions

When CodeLens is enabled, clickable links appear above each request:

- **Send Request** - Send this specific request
- **Send All Requests Sequentially** - Execute all requests in the file

Customize the text via settings:
- `rest-client.codeLensSendRequestTitle`
- `rest-client.codeLensSendAllRequestTitle`

## Status Bar Indicators

The status bar shows request execution status:

- **Spinner** - Request in progress (click to cancel)
- **Duration** - Total time (hover for breakdown: Socket, DNS, TCP, First Byte, Download)
- **Size** - Response size (hover for headers/body breakdown)
- **Environment** - Current environment name (click to switch)

## Response Preview Actions

In the response preview panel, use the title bar icons:

- **Save Full Response** - Save headers + body to file
- **Save Response Body** - Save body only with appropriate extension
- **More Actions...** - Access additional options:
  - Fold Response
  - Unfold Response
  - Copy Response Body
  - Preview in New Editor

## Per-Request Settings in Code

Add special comments before a request to modify its behavior:

```http
# @note Critical request - double check!
# @no-redirect
# @no-cookie-jar
DELETE https://api.example.com/data
```

These are processed as commands for that specific request only.

## Enabling/Disabling Commands

Some commands can be toggled via settings:

| Setting | Affects | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `rest-client.enableSendRequestCodeLens` | Send Request CodeLens | `true` |
| `rest-client.enableCustomVariableReferencesCodeLens` | Variable reference CodeLens | `true` |
| `rest-client.rememberCookiesForSubsequentRequests` | Cookie persistence | `true` |
| `rest-client.followredirect` | Auto-follow redirects | `true` |

## Command Execution Flow

Understanding when commands are available:

1. **File must be saved** - Some commands require the file to be saved to disk
2. **Language mode** - Commands work in `HTTP`, `plaintext`, or Markdown code blocks with `http`/`rest`
3. **Cursor position** - Send Request uses the request block where cursor is located
4. **Selection** - If text is selected, only that selection is sent as a request

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Shortcut not working?
- Ensure file language mode is `HTTP` (check bottom-right status bar)
- Check for conflicts in VS Code keyboard shortcuts (`File → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts`)
- Some shortcuts may be captured by other extensions

### Command not appearing in palette?
- Verify the extension is activated (open Command Palette and type "Rest Client")
- Reload VS Code (`Developer: Reload Window`)

### CodeLens not showing?
- Check `rest-client.enableSendRequestCodeLens` is `true`
- Verify VS Code setting `editor.codeLens` is enabled
- May be hidden by theme; check `workbench.colorCustomizations`

### Send Request sends wrong request?
- Place cursor inside the desired request block
- Use selected text to send specific portion
- Named requests with `# @name` can be referenced via request variables
